Hello, everyone. My name is Sun Hao.I graduated from Beijing University of Technology with a master's degree. I am a front-end engineer. However, with the rapid development of AI nowadays, I would prefer to call myself a software engineer because AI has expanded the boundaries of developers. Currently, I am working at Kuaishou. Previously, I have worked in companies such as ByteDance and Meituan. I have rich development experiences in both B-side and C-side projects, and I am quite familiar with mainstream front-end technologies like React and Webpack. In the past, I managed a front-end team, so I have certain management experience.

Let me talk about my work experience at Kuaishou. I'm mainly engaged in the business of the e - commerce advertising platform. The site wide Promotion project aims to maximize the customer's ROI. Strategically, it integrates organic traffic and commercial traffic to increase the customer's GMV. In this project, I participated in writing the core code, using technologies such as React, MobX, and Formik. Technologically, I mainly made three optimizations:
Resource loading optimization
I sorted out the priority of page resources and improved the TTI (Time To Interactive) through methods like asynchronous loading and dynamic loading.
Automated data tracking solution
By injecting code during the Babel compilation phase and combining it with runtime operations, I achieved automatic reporting of click events.
